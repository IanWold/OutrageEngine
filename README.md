Outrage Engine
==============

I'm making a game engine for ASCII games in the Windows Console, because the Windows Console is the best platform for cutting-edge gaming (duh). It's in Alpha right now, and the docs still need to be written, but we're going full steam ahead with it.

There's an example game in *OutrageTest* that shows the basics of getting something up and running. In addition, a friend and I used an earlier version of the engine to make [this fantastic maze game](https://github.com/IanWold/ConsoleMazeWoot).

It doesn't work so well in Windows 10 as far as I've been able to test, but should be fine on 8 or earlier. The console may require some specific settings to work properly. Using the older version of the console seems to be the best way to go.

Work to be done
---------------

Here is some of the work that needs to go into the beta version:

1. Menu system
2. Create a few terrain management options
3. Create a template for VS
4. Write the docs
5. Optimize it
6. Create a samples library of pre-made assets
7. Finish a sample game showing off everything
