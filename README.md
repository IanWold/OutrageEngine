I'm making a game engine for console ASCII games. It's in the very early prototype now, but the name is 100% final.

Work to be done
---------------

Here is some of the work that needs to go into the alpha version:

* Levels/Scenes
* Create a few terrain management options
* Menu system
* Optimize it
* Create a samples library of pre-made assets
* Create a template for VS
* Write the docs
* Finish a sample game showing off everything
